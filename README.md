**üîç Key Insights**
**Top Performers by Views**

Channels like DanTDM, Dan Rhodes, and Mister Max rank among the top 10 by total views.

The average views per video across channels is 0.09M, which appears low‚Äîpotentially due to skew from channels with many low-performing videos.

**Subscriber Metrics**

High-subscriber channels such as Rhia Official (12.3M), Sidemen (21M), and Sing King / Shaun the Sheep (11.8M) do not appear in the top views list, indicating either low video output or moderate engagement.

The Views per Subscriber metric is extremely high at 567.99, indicating strong viewer interest or viral content patterns.

**Engagement Analysis**

The Subscriber Engagement Ratio is 163.88, suggesting an active and involved audience.

Several channels with low video counts (e.g., TGFbro, Syndicate) still achieve strong performance, highlighting the impact of quality or niche content.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
**For Marketers and Brands**
Focus collaboration efforts on creators like Sidemen, DanTDM, and Rhia Official, who have a strong and engaged subscriber base.

Channels with high Views per Subscriber deliver better ROI even with modest follower counts‚Äîideal for targeted marketing.

**For Content Creators**
Consistently high-performing channels often succeed with quality over quantity‚Äîfocus on unique or viral-ready content.

Channels with large subscribers but fewer views (e.g., Rhia Official) should assess their content strategy or increase posting frequency.

**For Further Analysis**
Consider breaking down engagement by content category (e.g., gaming, music, kids).

Adding a trend over time (monthly/yearly growth in views or subscribers) can help forecast future performance and popularity trajectories.
